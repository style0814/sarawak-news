## Sarawak News

Sarawak-focused news aggregation platform built with Next.js and SQLite.
Includes user auth, comments, bookmarks, admin dashboard, RSS ingestion, and AI summaries.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Railway Persistence Checklist

If deployed on Railway with SQLite, do these to prevent user data loss on redeploy:

1. Create and attach a persistent volume to this service.
2. Mount it at `/data`.
3. Set `DATABASE_PATH=/data/news.db` in Railway service variables.
4. Redeploy once and verify a test account still exists after another deploy.

Without persistent volume + `DATABASE_PATH`, new users/comments/bookmarks can disappear after restart.
